# Motion Planning App

A small [web application](https://quimortiz.pythonanywhere.com/) designed for solving motion planning problems in robotics. Experiment with various problems and planners, modify them, and even upload and solve your own problems!

The Motion Planning App is a compact web application built around the C++/Python package DynoRRT. To solve motion planning problems on your local computer with an easy-to-use interface and state-of-the-art performance, you can simply use:

```
pip3 install pydynorrt
```

The online tutorial with [jupyter notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/quimortiz/dynorrt/main?labpath=notebooks%2Ftutorial0.ipynb) provides a comprehensive overview of the python package (it runs online on Binder and does not require local installation, but it may take a while to set up).
